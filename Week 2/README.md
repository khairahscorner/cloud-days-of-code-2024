# WEEK 2 (15/01/24 to 21/01/2024)
In this week, I focused more on coding for a take-home challenge.

## Day 1
- Explored more resources on deploying the full-stack app with AWS CDK, and reached a (temporary) conclusion that CDK may  still be a bit limited in what I assumed I could use it for. Some resources to explore later:
  - [Deploy a DB using CDK](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/learn-how-to-create-an-rds-instance-using-aws-cdk-typescript-a688d9f13cba)
  - [Full stack app deployment with CDK Pipeline](https://subaud.io/blog/creating-a-full-stack-app-with-cdk-pipeline)
  - [Docs on CDK Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cdk_pipeline.html)
  Some tasks/setup may still require visiting the console (or using other infrastructure automation tools)??

- Base setup for the take-home challenge (including landing view)

## Day 2
- Spent a chunk of the day working on the take-home task.
- Built a React + Vite app for the game frontend, and worked on the functionalities as well
- Worked on matching my solution to some expected benchmarks: usability, cross-device compatibility, responsiveness, design, architecture, etc

## Day 3
- Included additional features and fixes for the game
- Refactored codebased for modularity and readability
- More cleanups + documentation

## Day 4
- Attended an in-person cloud event: AWS re:Invent recap Manchester!
- More cleanups
- Wrote (or attempted to!) tests for the app: This encounter taught me a lot more about tests are crucial in web app development than I'd ever learnt! Now looking to take TDD more seriously and do on a JEST crash course. Some resources:
  - [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
  - [React Testing Library docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/)
  - [Jest YT Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPiUDhwnZxA)
  - [Mock API calls for testing](https://dev.to/zaklaughton/the-only-3-steps-you-need-to-mock-an-api-call-in-jest-39mb)
  - [Testing API calls](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-test-useeffect-api-call/)
